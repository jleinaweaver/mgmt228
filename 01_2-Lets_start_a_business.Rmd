# Our Plan This Semester

\begin{large}

\textbf{Build models to answer questions with data}

\begin{itemize}

\item What drives economic investment in US states? 

\item Why do some countries attract greater levels of international investment than others?

\item What explains why some individuals make more money than others?

\end{itemize}

\end{large}
