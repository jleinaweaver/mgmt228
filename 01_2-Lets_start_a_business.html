Come to class ready to make an argument (**with evidence**):

If you were starting a new business in the US **what** would it be, **where** specifically would you do it and what **criteria** did you use to decide?

## Prep for Class
1. Check evidence submissions
2. Upload business attractiveness data to Moodle AND include URL to webpage with methodology on it

&lt;br&gt;

Welcome back!

DID EVERYBODY SUBMIT THEIR EVIDENCE?

WITH A COUPLE DAYS TO REFLECT, ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SYLLABUS?

EVERYBODY CLEAR ON HOW TO EARN THEIR PARTICIPATION POINT IN EVERY CLASS?

My job in this class is to help you develop concrete, applied skills in data analytics that will help you make better management decisions.

At times this semester our work will feel very formulaic as we learn technical skills using Excel.

And at other times you are going to feel a bit lost at sea, because calculating an average is easy, but figuring out what that value means for who you should hire, where you should build a new factory or what kind of business you should start is WAY harder.

So, today we warm into our work with the assignment I set for you.

QUESTIONS ON THE THREE PROMPTS?

*Notes on Board*: 1) What? (Type of business), 2) Where? (Location), 3) Why? (Important criteria)

Let's hear your answers!

&lt;br&gt;

WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THESE RESPONSES AND LISTS?

&lt;br&gt;

YOU ARE A BUNCH OF VALUABLE YOUNG MINDS, ISN'T IT USEFUL TO KNOW HOW YOU THINK ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP? WHY OR WHY NOT?

- PERCEIVED GROWTH INDUSTRIES?

- PERCEIVED GROWTH LOCATIONS?

&lt;br&gt;

Focus in especially on the criteria column and let's talk models of decision-making.

WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS ALL OF THESE ANSWERS, IS THERE A MODEL HERE? OR EVIDENCE OF MULTIPLE MODELS BEING USED IN THE CLASS?

+ Some simplified way we can describe how you, as a group, think about starting a new business?

*Force this discussion*

Is this a useful model of the business start-up decision?]

[Girsch-Bock, Mary. (2021, Jan 19). "Top 10 Best States to Start Your Small Business in 2021." The Blueprint by The Motley Fool.](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/top-10-best-states-to-start-your-small-business/)

&lt;br&gt;

Talk to the people around you.

Make sure everyone can open the data and the web page.

Get ready to report back to me on the model created by Girsch-Bock.

&lt;br&gt;

Let's start by evaluating the variables chosen.

AT A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL, ARE THESE THE SEVEN MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR ALL PROSPECTIVE NEW BUSINESSES? WHY OR WHY NOT?

&lt;br&gt;

Now let's evaluate the measurement of each.

IS EACH PULLED FROM A HIGH QUALITY SOURCE? WHY OR WHY NOT?

&lt;br&gt;

WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF TRANSFORMING EACH MEASURE TO A 1-10 SCALE?

+ ANY IDEA WHY THEY DO THIS?

(Easier to combine, prevents weighting problems of scale)

&lt;br&gt;

Now let's dig into the spreadsheet!

IS EVERYBODY COMFORTABLE OPENING AND VIEWING DATA IN EXCEL?

+ (You can do this in any computer lab on campus) OR

+ (Install Office for free as a Drury student on your personal computer) OR

+ (Use the web version of Excel through your student log-ins on Webmail)

That last one should really just be for emergencies because there is a lot it cannot do.

QUESTIONS ON HOW TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE? ANY TROUBLES GETTING IT RUNNING?

&lt;br&gt;

WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF THIS DATA? HOW HAS IT BEEN ORGANIZED?

TALK ME THROUGH WHAT YOU SEE HERE AND HOW IT FORCES YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE BUSINESS START-UP MODEL.

+ (Rows as observations, Columns as variables)
+ (Leads with "rank" and "total score")
+ (Anything particular about the order of the variables after that in terms of implied priority?)

&lt;br&gt;

HOW DOES MISSOURI DO ON THESE VARIABLES?

DOES THIS TELL US ANYTHING USEFUL ABOUT MISSOURI'S COMPETITIVENESS WITH OTHER STATES? WHY OR WHY NOT?

&lt;br&gt;

Take a couple of minutes to go through the data.

Find us interesting observations!

ANYTHING IN TERMS OF MEASURES OR THE CONDITION OF STATES STAND OUT FOR YOU? WHY?

&lt;br&gt;

BOTTOM LINE, HOW USEFUL IS THIS AS A MODEL FOR STARTING A NEW BUSINESS IN THE US?

+ WHAT IS MISSING? 

+ ANY OF THESE VARIABLES YOU WOULD DELETE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC BUSINESS TYPE?

# Our Plan This Semester

.size40[
Build models to answer questions with data

+ What drives economic investment in US states? 

+ Why do some countries attract greater levels of international investment than others?

+ What explains why some individuals make more money than others?
]

???

Everything we've been doing today represents the kind of work we'll be doing all semester at a fundamental level.

We will attack questions like these on the slide using data and increasingly more involved analytical methods.

However, let's never lose sight of the point of all this.

We want to be data driven decision-makers and we never want other people to be able to take advantage of our ignorance about the data!

QUESTIONS?

&lt;br&gt;

Everybody open the syllabus and check out what you have to do for Tuesday.

WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?

- ANY QUESTIONS ON THE ASSIGNMENT?
