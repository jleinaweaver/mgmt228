For the final project you have been hired by a company to help them analyze their sales performance.

<br>

You have been given data on the performance of their sales team and will be asked to do three things.

1. Identify the best and worst members of their sales team,

2. Build a recruitment model that predicts individual sales, and 

3. Create a forecast for company wide sales in the next quarter.

I am giving you quarterly sales data for the 16 members of the sales team.

<br>

### Everybody have the data open?
### - Can they see the structure here?

<br>

SLIDE: Let's start by looking at the sales piece of the data.

Here are the records of Bob's first two years of sales history (2017 and 2018 by quarter).

- Keep in mind, sales here is in thousands of dollars.

*Walk them through Bob's first 8 quarters*

The company is also providing you with Dataset basic demographic information for each salesperson

- Here I'm showing you 7 of the 16 team members.

Important to note, this is across time data!

- While most demographics do not change across time, age certainly does!

<br>

Here we see a yearly snapshot of Bob's data across time.

- I'm trying to make this as concrete and realistic for you as I can.

### Questions on the data itself?

# Final Report: Three Sections
]

<br>

.size45[
.center[**Each section requires a complete argument**]

- Introduction, body and conclusion
- Every claim requires statistical evidence
]

???

As I noted at the start, you are being asked to answer three SEPARATE questions by this company.

1. Identify the best and worst members of their sales team,

2. Build a recruitment model that predicts individual sales, and 

3. Create a forecast for company wide sales in the next quarter.

<br>

Each section requires a short BUT complete argument from you:

- Introduction, body and conclusion

- Support all claims with data, visualizations, descriptive statistics or model results

### Questions on this?

<br>

I will give you all of our class session today, both classes next week and the full final exam period to work on this in class.

- Almost 6 hours of in-class time to work on this

<br>

SLIDE: Let's talk through the three sections.

# Final Report: Section 1

<br>

.size50[
**Who are the three best performing and the three worst performing members of our sales team?**
]

???

### Take a look at the description of Section 1 on Moodle and tell me if you have any questions.

<br>

Key Details:

- You should consider performance **both** in terms of **total sales** and in terms of **year-to-year growth**.

- Make an argument and support it with visualizations and descriptive statistics.

# Final Report: Section 2

<br>

.size45[
**What is the profile of our most successful salespeople?** 

**Build a multiple OLS regression in order to identify the most useful predictors of quarterly sales.**
]

???

Section 2 represents the company thinking about future recruiting.

### Take a look at the description of Section 2 on Moodle and tell me if you have any questions.

<br>

Predictors: Age, education, gender, region of the country, time and the quarter of the year.

<br>

Be sure to include:
- a properly formatted regression table, 

- evaluate your model with all five textbook steps (including a residual plot), and 

- make a marginal effects plot to visualize the strongest predictor of sales.

# Final Report: Section 3

<br>

.size45[
**What is your best forecast of our company-wide sales for the next quarter (Winter 2022)?**

**How confident are you in this projection?**
]

???

### Take a look at the description of Section 3 on Moodle and tell me if you have any questions.

<br>

Key notes:

- You will need to combine the sales figures for all of our salespeople in each quarter to calculate a quarterly total for the business as a whole.

- The strength of your argument, e.g. your level of confidence, increases with the number of forecasting methods you apply and evaluate.  

- **Be sure to provide your forecast results in both a table and a visualization.**

<br>

Forecasting Methods we explored in class: 
- Naive, 
- Moving Average (MA), 
- Weighted Moving Average (WMA), 
- Exponential Smoothing, and 
- Linear Prediction Models (options including: quadratic forms, cubic forms, and dummies for seasons or months)
