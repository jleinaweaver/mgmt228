Same format as the expectations for the other reports this semester.

- Support all claims with data, visualizations, descriptive statistics or model results

<br>

I will give you all of our class sessions in weeks 14, 15 and during the final exam window.
- Almost 6 hours of in-class time to work on this

**How has our sales staff performed over the last year (2021)?**

Who are our strongest and weakest salespeople?
]]

???

Details:

- Consider performance **both** in terms of **total sales** and in terms of **year-to-year growth**.

- Make an argument and support it with visualizations and descriptive statistics.

# Final Report: Section 2

<br>

.size45[
**What is the profile of our most successful salespeople?** 

Build a multiple OLS regression in order to identify the most useful predictors of quarterly sales.
]

???

Predictors: Age, education, gender, region of the country, time and the quarter of the year.

<br>

Be sure to include:
- a properly formatted regression table, 

- evaluate your model with all five textbook steps (including a residual plot), and 

- make a marginal effects plot to visualize the strongest predictor of sales.

# Final Report: Section 3

<br>

.size45[
**What is your best forecast of our company-wide sales for the next quarter (Winter 2022)?**

How confident are you in this projection?
]

???

Key notes:

- You will need to combine the sales figures for all of our salespeople in each quarter to calculate a quarterly total for the business as a whole.

- The strength of your argument, e.g. your level of confidence, increases with the number of forecasting methods you apply and evaluate.  

- **Be sure to provide your forecast results in both a table and a visualization.**

<br>

Forecasting Methods we explored in class: 
- Naive, 
- Moving Average (MA), 
- Weighted Moving Average (WMA), 
- Exponential Smoothing, and 
- Linear Prediction Models (options including: quadratic forms, cubic forms, and dummies for seasons or months)
